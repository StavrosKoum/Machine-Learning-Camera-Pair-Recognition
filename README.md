# Software-Development-part-2

This project extends the functionality of the first project

([Project1](https://github.com/panoskorovesis/Software-Development-part-1)) by adding negative interrelations between the .json files and appying

machine learning algorithms to the data.

Using the 80% of the data as a Train set and the remaining 20% as a Test set,

we apply the Train set to a **Logistic Regression** classifier -build from scratch- 

and then we test the model using the Test set.

For each prediction from the model, we print the actual result.

Results are in the file: predictions.txt

For more intricate documentation check the file **readme.pdf**.
