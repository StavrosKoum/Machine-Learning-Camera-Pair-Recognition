# Software-Development-part-3

This project extends the functionality of the first project

([Project2](https://github.com/panoskorovesis/Software-Development-part-2)) By changing the train process as follows

Train set is being extended for each train repetition depending on the thresh-hold value.

Each json file vector has been replaced by a sparce matrix to make the process more efficient.

In addition a thread pool has been implemented to divide the train function in smaller, parallel runing parts being handled by threads.
